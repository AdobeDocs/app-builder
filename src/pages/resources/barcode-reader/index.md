# Headless Apps with App Builder

This Code Lab will guide you through creating a headless app using App Builder.   

The app will generate a code128 barcode based on the user provided value. It's a simple app that can be used and adapted for different use cases.

* The project source code of the Code Lab is available [here](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adobeio-samples-barcode-generator).
* [Live demo](https://ringel.adobeioruntime.net/api/v1/web/my-barcode-app-0.0.1/barcode?value=adobe). You should see a barcode image which is rendered with the value `adobe`.
