# Well done

**You've reached the end**. This is all it takes to build a Firefly Headless App.
Now you can leverage the barcode action for example in an [email template inside Adobe Campaign](https://medium.com/adobetech/adobe-i-o-runtime-polishing-the-rough-edges-of-saas-solutions-238f82b58765).   

## Achievements

In this codelab, you've learnt how to: 

* Bootstrap a Firefly Headless App with the Firefly CLI
* Write a Runtime action with parameters 
* Write Unit and E2E tests for a Runtime action  
* Deploy a Runtime action locally    
* Deploy a Runtime web action on Adobe infrastructure
