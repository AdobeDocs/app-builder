# Lesson 4: Integrate and Use the Custom Worker in AEMaaCS

When the custom workers are done, you could deploy them onto I/O Runtime serverless platform to make them ready for integration in AEMaaCS. Execute the command `aio app deploy`, which will output all the endpoints of your custom workers in this format `https://1234-projectA-workspaceB.adobeioruntime.net/api/v1/web/dx-asset-compute-worker-1/worker-name`.

Next, in AEMaaCS, go to `Tools -> Assets -> Processing Profiles` to create a new processing profile. Give it a name, then under the Custom tab, configure the processing service to map the custom worker endpoints to corresponding renditions.

After saving the new profile, you need to apply it to a DAM folder.

Finally, you can test your custom workers by uploading images to the applied folder. After a few seconds for image processing, you can see the new renditions including the "cutout" generated by the custom worker.
