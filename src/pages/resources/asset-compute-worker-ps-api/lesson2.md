faqs:
- question: Which cloud storage providers can I use for the Asset Compute Developer tool?
  answer: You can use either Amazon S3 or Azure Storage by adding the respective storage credentials to your configuration.
- question: Where do I add my cloud storage credentials for the Developer tool?
  answer: Add your S3 or Azure cloud storage credentials as environment variables in your `.env` file.
- question: How do I obtain and configure the private key file for my App Builder project?
  answer: Download the `<namespace>-<workspace>.json` file from the Adobe Developer Console, rename it to `console.json`, and place it in the root folder of your project.
- question: How do I start the Asset Compute Developer tool locally?
  answer: Run `aio app run` in your project root to deploy the action to Adobe I/O Runtime and start the local development tool on `http://localhost:9000`.
- question: What does the sample worker code for the rendition do?
  answer: The sample code simply copies the source file to create a new rendition without modification.

# Lesson 2: Configure the App
# Lesson 2: Configure the App

As you log in when creating the application, most of the App Builder credentials get collected in your `.env` file. However, using the Developer tool requires additional credentials.

The Developer tool used to test custom applications with the actual Asset Compute service requires a cloud storage container for hosting test files and for receiving and displaying renditions generated by applications.

> Note: This is separate from the cloud storage of Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service. It applies only to development and testing using the Asset Compute Developer tool.

You can use either S3 or Azure storage for this purpose by adding credentials of (only) one storage solution.

```bash
# S3 credentials
S3_BUCKET=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_REGION=

# Azure Storage credentials
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=
AZURE_STORAGE_KEY=
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME=
```

Then add the absolute path to the private key file created while adding services to your App Builder Project:

```bash
ASSET_COMPUTE_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE_PATH=
```

Finally, download the file from the Adobe Developer Console. Go to the root of the workspace you are using and click on “Download All” in the upper-right corner. The file is downloaded with `<namespace>-<workspace>.json` as the filename. Rename it to `console.json` and move it in the root folder of your project.

Once all the credentials are properly configured, you can execute the application with the Asset Compute Developer Tool by the command `aio app run`. This deploys the action to Adobe I/O Runtime and starts the development tool, available at `http://localhost:9000`, on your local machine. You can then upload a test image, specify the rendition request, and then run the test to see the rendition result. Here is an example rendition request:

```json
"renditions": [
    {
        "worker": "https://1234-projectA-workspaceB.adobeioruntime.net/api/v1/web/example-custom-worker-0.0.1/worker",
        "name": "custom_rendition.png"
    }
]
```

Looking at the action code in `actions/<worker-name>/index.js`, you can see it simply copies the source file to generate a new rendition.

```javascript
const { worker, SourceCorruptError } = require('@adobe/asset-compute-sdk');
const fs = require('fs').promises;

exports.main = worker(async (source, rendition) => {
    await fs.copyFile(source.path, rendition.path);
});
```
