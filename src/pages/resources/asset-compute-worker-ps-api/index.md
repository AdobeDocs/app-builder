# Build AEM Asset Compute Worker with Photoshop API

Many rendition requirements such as converting to formats and resizing images are addressed by Processing Profiles in Experience Manager as a Cloud Service (AEMaaCS). More complex business requirements may need custom-created solutions that suit specialized requirements. Asset Compute Service can be extended to support those use cases by creating custom applications that are called from Processing Profiles in Experience Manager.

Support for Photoshop APIs makes this even easier. The Photoshop magics are now available on the cloud, at scale, to automate repetitive design tasks and keep your team doing what they do best.

With the support of Photoshop APIs, this becomes even easier. The Photoshop magics are now available on the cloud, at scale. It helps to automate repetitive design tasks and keep your team doing what they do best.

This Code Lab will show you how to build an AEM Assets Compute Worker using App Builder and Photoshop APIs to generate custom image renditions.

You can review a sample project as the result of this Code Lab at [AdobeDocs/adobeio-samples-assets-compute-photoshop](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adobeio-samples-assets-compute-photoshop).
