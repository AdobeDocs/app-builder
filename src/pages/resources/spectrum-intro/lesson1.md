# Lesson 1: Introduction to Spectrum

Spectrum is Adobe's design system, with design guidelines and recommended components to create a unified experience across all Adobe Clouds. A team of Adobe engineers and User Experience designers launched the Spectrum initiative years ago; today it is publicly released and gaining community support. 

Resources for the Spectrum design system are available on [Adobe's Spectrum website](https://spectrum.adobe.com).

## For all platforms

Spectrum applies to all platforms, both desktop and mobile, from the ground up. Since people work with different products and often need to switch context, Spectrum's scale system provides better legibility and easier UI interactions for consistent experiences across devices.

## For everyone

Spectrum is designed to be clearly readable, intuitive to use, and mindful of those who require alternative input peripherals or screen readers. Everything in the system — from color and type to interaction and language — is built to be compliant with industry standards.

## Evolving and transparent

Spectrum is built with transparency at its core. Everything in the system has its own versioning, a list of open issues, and a design checklist to communicate its status. 
The team constantly communicates what it's working on, sets clear expectations, and builds trust with users to strengthen the relationships that help products and industries grow.

## Built by a community

Spectrum connects different talents, viewpoints, and skills into something that benefits all Adobe products. Anyone at Adobe can contribute to a collection of design elements to be considered as additions to the design system.
