# Setup CI/CD in an App Builder App

App Builder allows you to manage multiple environments called workspaces. Each workspace has its own setup: 

* List of Adobe services to integrate via user or technical user accounts
* Runtime namespace
* Cloud storage for the SPA static files
* Content Delivery Network (CDN) delegation and sub-domain provisioned on adobeio-static.net
* Related credentials and secrets (API Key, access token, Runtime namespace credentials...)

We recommend reviewing the [App Builder CI/CD documentation](../../guides/app_builder_guides/deployment/cicd-for-app-builder-apps.md) to learn more about the architectural details.

This Code Lab will show you how to create a CI/CD worflow for a stage and production environment using [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) within an App Builder App.   

For that, we'll use the default bootstrapped project provided through the [CLI](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli) included with App Builder, which provides a sample CI/CD workflow.
