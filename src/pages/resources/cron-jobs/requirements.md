## Code Lab Environment
## Code Lab Environment

Note that the alarms package described in this lab is available only in the Adobe I/O Runtime environment. In other words, you need to run and deploy your app with either of these commands: `aio app run` or `aio app deploy`. You will not be able to use the package in the local standalone OpenWhisk deployment, which comes with `aio app run --local`.
