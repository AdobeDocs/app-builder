# Requirements

This codelab is useful for anyone who are getting started with developing Firefly apps.

## Required skills

* **Required:** programming skills in any language
* *Optional:* basic knowledge with Javascript and Node.js

## Pre-requisites

If not already done, you should follow the below links to have your environment set up before starting the codelab:

* [How to Get Access to Project Firefly](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/project-firefly/blob/master/overview/getting_access.md)
* [Setting up Your Environment](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/project-firefly/blob/master/getting_started/setup.md)
* [Creating your First Firefly App](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/project-firefly/blob/master/getting_started/first_app.md)

## Codelab environment

Please note that, the alarms package mentioned in this lab is only available in Adobe I/O Runtime environment. In other words, you need to run and deploy your app with either of these commands: `aio app run` or `aio app deploy`. You will not be able to use it in the local standalone OpenWhisk deployment, which comes with `aio app run --local`.
