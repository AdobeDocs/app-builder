# Get Started with Adobe I/O Runtime

Adobe I/O Runtime is Adobeâ€™s serverless computing platform based on Apache OpenWhisk, an open-source project of the Apache Software Foundation. Runtime lets you deploy your own custom code to the cloud and call it as needed, so you can execute functions, also called "actions," from the cloud without deploying or configuring a server. 

Runtime delivers a flexible, on-demand computing resource: function-as-a-service. It  lets you easily access Adobe content, data, and services, orchestrate custom business workflows, and create powerful applications that respond to events from Adobe I/O Events.
