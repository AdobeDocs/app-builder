faqs:
- question: What is Adobe I/O Runtime?
  answer: Adobe I/O Runtime is a serverless platform based on Apache OpenWhisk that lets you deploy and run your own code in the cloud without managing servers. It enables building event-driven applications using functions called actions.
- question: How do I get started with Adobe I/O Runtime?
  answer: You can start by setting up your environment, deploying your first action, and retrieving invocation results with the step-by-step tutorials provided in the documentation.
- question: What kind of applications can I build with Adobe I/O Runtime?
  answer: You can create custom workflows, automate tasks, and build applications that respond to Adobe I/O Events, leveraging Adobe content and data through flexible, on-demand cloud functions.

# Get Started with Adobe I/O Runtime

Adobe I/O Runtime is Adobe’s serverless computing platform based on Apache OpenWhisk, an open-source project of the Apache Software Foundation. Runtime lets you deploy your own custom code to the cloud and call it as needed, so you can execute functions, also called "actions," from the cloud without deploying or configuring a server. 

Runtime delivers a flexible, on-demand computing resource: function-as-a-service. It  lets you easily access Adobe content, data, and services, orchestrate custom business workflows, and create powerful applications that respond to events from Adobe I/O Events.
