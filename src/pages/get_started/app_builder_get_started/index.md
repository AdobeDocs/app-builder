# App Builder and Adobe I/O Runtime

App Builder greatly simplifies the process of building cloud native applications that run on Adobe I/O Runtime. 

If you have existing actions (for example, headless applications) deployed on Adobe I/O Runtime and you want to convert them to App Builder applications, these are the main steps:

* Create a new project in the [Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/) and choose the App Builder template
* Configure the Adobe CLI and use it to initialize a new application for the project you created above; see also [Setting Up Your Environment](set_up.md)
* Create copies of your actions in this project
* Deploy and test the new actions
* Update your applications to point to the new actions

## Next step

See what else App Builder can do: [Create your First App Builder Application](first_app.md).
