# Distribution Overview

Developers may distribute App Builder applications privately or publicly.

## Private

Privately distributed apps are available only to users in the Developer's organization. They are submitted through the [Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/), reviewed by an Administrator of the organization, and accessed through the [App Builder Catalog](https://experience.adobe.com/#/@adobeio/custom-apps). 

See [Publishing Your First App Builder Application](../../get_started/app_builder_get_started/publish-app.md) for a thorough discussion of this topic and a hands-on sample project.

> Note: Only Adobe Experience Cloud Shell extensions may appear in the App Builder Catalog.

## Public

Publicly distributed apps are available for installation by anyone on [Adobe Exchange](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/browse/ec). 

### Overview

Publicly distributed applications are available for any Adobe organization to install and distribute for access through [Adobe Exchange](https://exchange.adobe.com/). These apps are submitted through [Adobe Developer Distribution](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/) and reviewed by Adobe. This section reviews configuration options and the steps required to prepare your app for public distribution.

### Customer configuration

Developers of publicly distributable apps can define configuration options for customers to set during installation.

#### Defining customer configuration options

Customer configuration can be defined through the `configSchema` property.

**app.config.yaml**

```yaml
application:
  <application config>
extensions:
  <extension configs>
configSchema: # This is a top-level property and is global to the app and all extensions
  title: 'the title'
  description: 'the description'
  properties:
    - title: 'Slack Webhook'
      type: 'string'
      description: 'Please provide the webhook used by this application. Configure in slack.com'
      envKey: 'SLACK_WEBHOOK'
```

#### Usage

The `envKey` property of a customer configuration option maps to the environment variable name in the app.

##### Runtime action

To use customer configuration in a Runtime action, map the `envKey` value for the desired variable to the inputs of the Runtime action, then access values via `params.<envKey>` in the action code.

**app.config.yaml**

```yaml
configSchema:
  title: 'the title'
  description: 'the description'
  properties:
    - title: 'enable caching'
      type: 'boolean'
      envKey: 'IS_CACHING_ENABLED'                      <--- Environment variable name
application:
  actions: actions
  web: web-src
  runtimeManifest:
    packages:
      dx-excshell-1:
        license: Apache-2.0
        actions:
          generic:
            function: actions/generic/index.js
            web: 'yes'
            runtime: nodejs:16
            inputs:
              LOG_LEVEL: debug
              IS_CACHING_ENABLED: $IS_CACHING_ENABLED   <--- Mapped environment variable
            annotations:
              require-adobe-auth: true
              final: true
              code-download: true
```

**Action code**

```js
async function main (params) {
    if (params.IS_CACHING_ENABLED) {
        enableCache()
    }
}

exports.main = main
```

##### Web application

To use customer configuration in a web application, access values directly through `process.env.<envKey>`.

**app.config.yaml**

```yaml
configSchema:
  title: 'Configurable Web App'
  description: 'Web application that can be configured.'
  properties:
    - title: 'Frontend background color'
      type: string
      description: 'Please provide the background color for your frontend'
      enum:
        - blue-400
        - celery-400
        - indigo-400
      envKey: FRONTEND_BACKGROUND_COLOR                <--- Environment variable name
application:
  web: web-src
```

**Component.js**

```js
<View backgroundColor={process.env.FRONTEND_BACKGROUND_COLOR}></View>
```

#### Customer configuration types

##### Text field

```yaml
configSchema:
  title: 'Configure your application'
  description: 'Set configurable variables for this Slack application'
  properties:
    - title: 'Slack Webhook'
      type: 'string'
      description: 'Please provide the webhook used by this application. Configure in slack.com'
      envKey: 'SLACK_WEBHOOK'
      default: 'https://slack.com/webhook'
```

##### Checkbox

```yaml
configSchema:
  title: 'Configure your application'
  description: 'Customize this application to meet your needs.'
  properties:
    - title: 'Enable caching'
      description: 'Determines whether or not the app caches.'
      type: 'boolean'
      envKey: 'IS_CACHING_ENABLED'
```

##### Dropdown

```yaml
configSchema:
  title: 'Configurable Web App'
  description: 'Web application that can be configured.'
  properties:
    - title: 'Frontend background color'
      type: string
      description: 'Please provide the background color for your frontend'
      enum:
        - blue-400
        - celery-400
        - indigo-400
      envKey: FRONTEND_BACKGROUND_COLOR
```

##### Secret

```yaml
configSchema:
  title: 'the title'
  description: 'the description'
  properties:
    - title: 'aws secret key'
      type: 'string'
      secret: true 
      envKey: 'AWS_SECRET'
```

> Note: This secret screenshot is pending a bug fix.

##### Multiple configuration options

```yaml
configSchema:
  title: 'Configurable Web App'
  description: 'Web application that can be configured.'
  properties:
    - title: 'Frontend background color'
      type: string
      description: 'Please provide the background color for your frontend'
      enum:
        - blue-400
        - celery-400
        - indigo-400
      envKey: FRONTEND_BACKGROUND_COLOR
    - title: 'Enable caching'
      description: 'Determines whether or not the app caches.'
      type: 'boolean'
      envKey: 'IS_CACHING_ENABLED'
    - title: 'Slack Webhook'
      type: 'string'
      description: 'Please provide the webhook used by this application. Configure in slack.com'
      envKey: 'SLACK_WEBHOOK'
      default: 'https://slack.com/webhook'
```

### Required products

Developers of publicly distributable App Builder apps can define Adobe products that are required for their apps to work properly. The [Discover](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/experience-cloud/docs/guides/discoverandmanage/#discover) and [Acquire](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/experience-cloud/docs/guides/discoverandmanage/#acquire) sections of the distribution documentation show how these options are surfaced to customers.

#### Defining required products

Required products can be defined using the `productDependencies` property.

**app.config.yaml**

```yaml
application:
  <application config>
extensions:
  <extension configs>
configSchema: 
  <customer configuration>
productDependencies: 
  - code: AEP
    minVersion: 0.0.0
    maxVersion: 1.0.0
```

##### Valid products

- **AEM** - Experience Manager
- **AAM** - Audience Manager
- **ANLYTC** - Analytics
- **CMPGN** - Campaign
- **TRGT** - Target
- **AEP** - Experience Platform Services

Product version information can be found on [Adobe Experience League](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs).

### Packaging for developer distribution

Once an app is configured for public distribution, it can be packaged and uploaded to [Adobe Developer Distribution](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/). 

The `aio app pack` command verifies and bundles applications for upload. In the root of your app folder, run:

```sh
aio app pack
```

When it completes, you will find the app package in your app folder as `dist/app.zip`. Continue to the [Adobe Developer Distribution](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/) documentation for details on how to upload it.

#### Validation

When a Developer uploads a package to Adobe Developer Distribution, these validations are performed:

1. `app.config.yaml` is checked for format validity, returning configuration errors to fix if necessary
2. `package.json` version format must be `X.Y.Z`, where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers
3. files to be packaged - all files in your app folder will be packaged except:
   - files specified in `.gitignore`
   - files specified in `.npmignore`
   - any `dist` folders
   - any dot files (.env, .gitignore, etc)
   - any OS junk files (.DS_Store, thumbs.db, etc)
4. event registrations, if any, for validity

#### Hooks

Two [hooks](architecture_overview/app-hooks.md) are available to customize the packaging step:

1. `pre-pack` - runs before packaging
2. `post-pack` - runs after packaging

Hook-handler functions will be passed two items:

1. `appConfig` (object) contains the configuration of the current application
2. `artifactsFolder` (string) is the location of the folder that contains all the packaging artifacts to be bundled
