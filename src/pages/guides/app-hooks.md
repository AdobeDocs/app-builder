# App Builder application tooling lifecycle event hooks

Hooks can be defined to run before, after, or in place of many of the app plugin commands in the app.config.yaml or ext.config.yaml file of your app. 

## Command Support

`aio app run` supports:
```yaml
hooks:
  pre-app-run: echo pre-app-run
  post-app-run: echo post-app-run
  pre-app-build: echo pre-app-build
  post-app-build: echo post-app-build
  pre-app-deploy: echo pre-app-deploy
  post-app-deploy: echo post-app-deploy
  build-actions: echo build-actions
  deploy-actions: echo deploy-actions
  build-static: echo build-static
  serve-static: echo serve-static
  pre-app-undeploy: echo pre-app-undeploy
  post-app-undeploy: echo post-app-undeploy
  undeploy-actions: echo undeploy-actions
  undeploy-static: echo undeploy-static
```

`aio app build` supports:
```yaml
hooks:
  pre-app-build: echo pre-app-build
  post-app-build: echo post-app-build
  build-actions: echo build-actions
  build-static: echo build-static
 ```

`aio app deploy` supports:
```yaml
hooks:
  pre-app-build: echo pre-app-build
  post-app-build: echo post-app-build
  pre-app-deploy: echo pre-app-deploy
  post-app-deploy: echo post-app-deploy
  build-actions: echo build-actions
  build-static: echo build-static
  deploy-actions: echo deploy-actions
  deploy-static: echo deploy-static
```

`aio app undeploy` supports:
```yaml
hooks:
  pre-app-undeploy: echo pre-app-undeploy
  post-app-undeploy: echo post-app-undeploy
  undeploy-actions: echo undeploy-actions
  undeploy-static: echo undeploy-static
```

`aio app test` supports:
```yaml
hooks:
  test: echo this is your custom test runner
```

## Use cases

`aio app run` hooks:
- manage additional local development tooling that is not managed by the out-of-the-box flow

`aio app build` **build-static** and **build-actions** hooks:
- build actions to include static files with the action zipfile (for templates like in server-side rendering)
- build the web assets with a different bundler and configuration, for example webpack

`aio app deploy` **deploy-static** and **deploy-actions** hooks:
- support additional deployment steps (e.g. deploy to multiple servers or locations)

`aio app undeploy` **undeploy-static** and **undeploy-actions** hooks:
- support additional un-deployment steps (e.g. un-deploy from multiple servers or locations)

`aio app test` **test** hook:
- support a custom test runner for your app or extension

## Using JavaScript files

You can specify a JavaScript file that contains your hook code. This file must export a function. 

**app.config.yaml**
```yaml
hooks:
  post-app-deploy: ./hooks/post-app-deploy.js
```

**./hooks/post-app-deploy.js**
```js
module.exports = () => {
    console.log("Post app deploy hook")
}
```

## Legacy App (no extensions)

In the root of your app, you will have to add a `hooks` key in the `app.config.yaml` file, under the `application` key. Example:
```
application:
  hooks:
    pre-app-run: echo pre-app-run
```

If you add extensions to a standalone app via `aio app add extension`, note that your `app.config.yaml` hooks will always run first, then your extension hooks in each `ext.config.yaml` will be run.

## App with Extensions

In your app extension folder (typically at `src/EXTENSION_NAME`), find the `ext.config.yaml` file, and add in a `hooks` key. Example:
```
hooks:
  pre-app-run: echo pre-app-run
```

## Hooks flow

The following diagram illustrates how your custom hooks will be executed within the application via the various commands:
