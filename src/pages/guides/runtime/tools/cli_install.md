# Setting up the aio CLI

The `aio` CLI helps you to manage the `.wskprops` file as you use different namespaces. 

You need `npm` installed in order to install it. Before you start, make sure you have the latest version of Node and npm installed.

```
npm install -g @adobe/aio-cli
```

After this, you can run help to see all the commands and verify that you are all set:

```
aio -h
```

If you want to update to the latest version, run:
```
aio plugins:update
```

For more information about the `aio` CLI check the [package home page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/aio-cli).
