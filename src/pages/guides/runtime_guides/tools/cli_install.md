# Setting up the aio CLI

The `aio` CLI helps you to manage the `.wskprops` file as you use different namespaces. You will need `npm` to install it, so before you start, make sure you have the latest version of Node and npm installed.

```
npm install -g @adobe/aio-cli
```

Now you can run `help` to see all the commands and verify that you are ready:

```
aio help
```

To update to the latest versions of any plugins, reinstall the CLI:

```
npm install -g @adobe/aio-cli
```

For more information about the `aio` CLI, check the [package home page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/aio-cli).
