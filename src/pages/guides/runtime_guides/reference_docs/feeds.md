# Using Feeds

Feeds are streams of events. The difference between [triggers](triggersrules.md 'Using Triggers and Rules') and feeds is:

* **Triggers** are a way to classify events: each defines a type of event and is fired when that event is received by Runtime. Triggers are linked to actions by rules; each rule links a trigger to a single action.
* **Feeds** are streams of events that are all handled by the same trigger. Each feed is controlled by a _feed action_ that manages the stream: creating, deleting, pausing or resuming it as needed. In this way, a feed controls the flow of input to a trigger. Feed actions use a REST API to interact with external services that produce the events to which triggers are set to respond.

## Creating feeds: feed actions

To create a feed, you first need a feed action. A feed action is an action like any other, but to qualify as a feed action it needs to accept these parameters:

* **lifecycleEvent:** passes in commands to control the feed: `CREATE`, `READ`, `DELETE`, `PAUSE`, OR `UNPAUSE`
* **triggerName:** provides the fully qualified name of the trigger to associate with this feed
* **authKey:** the Basic auth credentials of the user who owns the trigger given in `triggerName`

The feed action can take any other parameters you choose; thesy should include any parameters needed to connect to the event source and manage the feed.

Once you have a feed action, create the feed when you create the trigger itself by using the `--feed` parameter. For example, assume you want to set up a feed for receiving updates to the user's location coming from your mobile app, and have created a feed action named `userLocChange` in a package in your namespace called `userLoc`. To create the feed for managing location updates, you could issue the following command in the CLI:

`aio rt:trigger:create trigLocUpdate --feed userLoc/userLocChange <optional parameters for the feed action>`

This command creates a trigger named `trigLocUpdate`.  Then do something like this:

`aio rt:action:invoke userLoc/userLocChange --param lifecycleEvent CREATE --param triggerName trigLocUpdate --param authKey <yourauthKey> --param <optional parameters>`

This invokes the feed action `userLocChange`, which sets up the stream of events from your mobile app aimed at the trigger `trigLocUpdate`.

You can use the `--feed` parameter to execute similar functions on feed actions within the `aio rt:trigger:delete`, `aio rt:trigger:update`, and `aio rt:trigger:get` commands.

## Feed implementation patterns

You can create a feed according to several different architectural patterns. Three good choices are:

* **Hooks:** This is the easiest option, if your event source offers a webhook facility. Simply set up the webhook to send an HTML POST directly to a URL to fire the trigger. This works best for low-frequency events.
* **Polling:** This is good for managing a regularly scheduled event, so long as it's not too frequent. Set up the feed action to poll an endpoint periodically to fetch new data.
* **Connections:** Sometimes, the volume and frequency of events makes it most efficient to set up a persistent connection. But since Runtime is architected as a REST service, a invocations of an action are destroyed as soon as they're executed; in other words, Runtime is by nature not persistent. One option is to set up an external service that maintains a persistent connection with your event source, and arrange for that service to fire events at your feed in Runtime.
