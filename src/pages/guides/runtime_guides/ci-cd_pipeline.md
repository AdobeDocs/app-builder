# CI/CD Pipeline

Adobe I/O Runtime offers a number of tools to help you build a CI/CD pipeline for managing your actions. 

## Namespaces

Namespaces can be used to separate different environments such as Development, QE, Staging, and Production. Since you can create as many namespaces as you need, you can deploy different versions of your actions to different environments as you promote a version up to Production.

## CLI tools

CLI tools `aio` and `wskdeploy` can help you automate deployments, manage action dependencies, and create manifest files that describe your packages and actions. Details about using `wskdeploy` can be found [here](creating_actions.md). 

## Swagger specifications

If you plan to expose your actions as REST APIs, Swagger definition files can help you to manage the API life cycle through creation, editing, and deletion, as described [here](creating_rest_apis.md#using-swagger-files).

## Versioning actions

A persistent problem when creating actions is versioning â€“ how to maintain different stages of development or updates of the same action. Packages offer an elegant solution.

Do this by creating a new package for every release you want to publish, and deploy all your actions in that package. Use the version number as part of the package name, or create a "latest" package that always holds the newest version. Client applications then have complete freedom to stay with a preferred version, always use the latest, or migrate according to their own schedules.

The AEM Commerce team documented this approach in a [blog post](https://medium.com/adobetech/functions-packaging-and-versioning-in-adobe-i-o-runtime-7accdfd95e0a).
