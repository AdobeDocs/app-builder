# Distribution Overview

Developers may distribute App Builder applications privately or publicly.

## Private

Privately distributed apps are available only to users in the Developer's organization. They are submitted through the [Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/), reviewed by an Administrator of the organization, and accessed through the [App Builder Catalog](https://experience.adobe.com/#/@adobeio/custom-apps). 

See [Publishing Your First App Builder Application](../../get_started/app_builder_get_started/publish-app.md) for a thorough discussion of this topic and a hands-on sample project.

> Note: Only Adobe Experience Cloud Shell extensions may appear in the App Builder Catalog.

## Public

Publicly distributed apps are available for installation by anyone on [Adobe Exchange](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/browse/ec). 

### Overview

Publicly distributed applications are available for any Adobe organization to install and distribute for access through [Adobe Exchange](https://exchange.adobe.com/). These apps are submitted through [Adobe Developer Distribution](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/) and reviewed by Adobe. This section reviews configuration options and the steps required to prepare your app for public distribution.

### Customer configuration

Developers of publicly distributable apps can define configuration options for customers to set during installation.

#### Defining customer configuration options

Customer configuration can be defined through the `configSchema` property.

**app.config.yaml**

```yaml
application:
  <application config>
extensions:
  <extension configs>
configSchema: # This is a top-level property and is global to the app and all extensions
  title: 'the title'
  description: 'the description'
  properties:
    - title: 'Slack Webhook'
      type: 'string'
      description: 'Please provide the webhook used by this application. Configure in slack.com'
      envKey: 'SLACK_WEBHOOK'
```

#### Usage

The `envKey` property of a customer configuration option maps to the environment variable name in the app.

##### Runtime action

To use customer configuration in a Runtime action, map the `envKey` value for the desired variable to the inputs of the Runtime action, then access values via `params.<envKey>` in the action code.

**app.config.yaml**

```yaml
configSchema:
  title: 'the title'
  description: 'the description'
  properties:
    - title: 'enable caching'
      type: 'boolean'
      envKey: 'IS_CACHING_ENABLED'                      <--- Environment variable name
application:
  actions: actions
  web: web-src
  runtimeManifest:
    packages:
      dx-excshell-1:
        license: Apache-2.0
        actions:
          generic:
            function: actions/generic/index.js
            web: 'yes'
            runtime: nodejs:16
            inputs:
              LOG_LEVEL: debug
              IS_CACHING_ENABLED: $IS_CACHING_ENABLED   <--- Mapped environment variable
            annotations:
              require-adobe-auth: true
              final: true
              code-download: true
```

**Action code**

```js
async function main (params) {
    if (params.IS_CACHING_ENABLED) {
        enableCache()
    }
}

exports.main = main
```

##### Web application

To use customer configuration in a web application, access values directly through `process.env.<envKey>`.

**app.config.yaml**

```yaml
configSchema:
  title: 'Configurable Web App'
  description: 'Web application that can be configured.'
  properties:
    - title: 'Frontend background color'
      type: string
      description: 'Please provide the background color for your frontend'
      enum:
        - blue-400
        - celery-400
        - indigo-400
      envKey: FRONTEND_BACKGROUND_COLOR                <--- Environment variable name
application:
  web: web-src
```

**Component.js**

```js
<View backgroundColor={process.env.FRONTEND_BACKGROUND_COLOR}></View>
```

#### Customer configuration types

##### Text field

```yaml
configSchema:
  title: 'Configure your application'
  description: 'Set configurable variables for this Slack application'
  properties:
    - title: 'Slack Webhook'
      type: 'string'
      description: 'Please provide the webhook used by this application. Configure in slack.com'
      envKey: 'SLACK_WEBHOOK'
      default: 'https://slack.com/webhook'
```

##### Checkbox

```yaml
configSchema:
  title: 'Configure your application'
  description: 'Customize this application to meet your needs.'
  properties:
    - title: 'Enable caching'
      description: 'Determines whether or not the app caches.'
      type: 'boolean'
      envKey: 'IS_CACHING_ENABLED'
```

##### Dropdown

```yaml
configSchema:
  title: 'Configurable Web App'
  description: 'Web application that can be configured.'
  properties:
    - title: 'Frontend background color'
      type: string
      description: 'Please provide the background color for your frontend'
      enum:
        - blue-400
        - celery-400
        - indigo-400
      envKey: FRONTEND_BACKGROUND_COLOR
```

##### Secret

```yaml
configSchema:
  title: 'the title'
  description: 'the description'
  properties:
    - title: 'aws secret key'
      type: 'string'
      secret: true 
      envKey: 'AWS_SECRET'
```

> Note: This secret screenshot is pending a bug fix.

##### Multiple configuration options

```yaml
configSchema:
  title: 'Configurable Web App'
  description: 'Web application that can be configured.'
  properties:
    - title: 'Frontend background color'
      type: string
      description: 'Please provide the background color for your frontend'
      enum:
        - blue-400
        - celery-400
        - indigo-400
      envKey: FRONTEND_BACKGROUND_COLOR
    - title: 'Enable caching'
      description: 'Determines whether or not the app caches.'
      type: 'boolean'
      envKey: 'IS_CACHING_ENABLED'
    - title: 'Slack Webhook'
      type: 'string'
      description: 'Please provide the webhook used by this application. Configure in slack.com'
      envKey: 'SLACK_WEBHOOK'
      default: 'https://slack.com/webhook'
```

### Required products

Developers of publicly distributable App Builder apps can define Adobe products that are required for their apps to work properly. The [Discover](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/experience-cloud/docs/guides/discoverandmanage/#discover) and [Acquire](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/experience-cloud/docs/guides/discoverandmanage/#acquire) sections of the distribution documentation show how these options are surfaced to customers.

#### Defining required products

Required products can be defined using the `productDependencies` property.

**app.config.yaml**

```yaml
application:
  <application config>
extensions:
  <extension configs>
configSchema: 
  <customer configuration>
productDependencies: 
  - code: AEP
    minVersion: 0.0.0
    maxVersion: 1.0.0
```

### Packaging for developer distribution

Once an app is configured for public distribution, it can be packaged and uploaded to [Adobe Developer Distribution](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/). 

#### Prerequisites

Before running `aio app pack`, especially on a freshly checked-out project that hasn't been run before, you need to ensure the project is properly configured and bound to an App Builder workspace. The packaging command requires that your local project is connected to a workspace with the necessary APIs and credentials.

If you're working with a newly cloned repository or a project that hasn't been set up yet, follow these steps:

1. **Create an App Builder project** in the [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console)
   
2. **Add the required APIs** to your workspace in the Developer Console

3. **Download the workspace configuration**
   - In the Developer Console, navigate to your workspace
   - Click "Download all" to get the `workspace.json` file

4. **Bind your local project to the workspace**
   ```sh
   aio app use workspace.json
   ```

5. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

6. **Run the app at least once** to complete the configuration binding
   ```sh
   aio app run
   ```
   
   Or alternatively:
   ```sh
   aio app dev
   ```

Once these steps are completed, your project will be properly configured and bound to the workspace, allowing you to successfully run the packaging command.

#### Running the Pack Command

The `aio app pack` command verifies and bundles applications for upload. In the root of your app folder, run:

```sh
aio app pack
```

When it completes, you will find the app package in your app folder as `dist/app.zip`. Continue to the [Adobe Developer Distribution](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/) documentation for details on how to upload it.

#### Validation

When a Developer uploads a package to Adobe Developer Distribution, these validations are performed:

1. `app.config.yaml` is checked for format validity, returning configuration errors to fix if necessary
2. `package.json` version format must be `X.Y.Z`, where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers
3. files to be packaged - all files in your app folder will be packaged except:
   - files specified in `.gitignore`
   - files specified in `.npmignore`
   - any `dist` folders
   - any dot files (.env, .gitignore, etc)
   - any OS junk files (.DS_Store, thumbs.db, etc)
4. event registrations, if any, for validity

#### Hooks

Two [hooks](architecture_overview/app-hooks.md) are available to customize the packaging step:

1. `pre-pack` - runs before packaging
2. `post-pack` - runs after packaging

Hook-handler functions will be passed two items:

1. `appConfig` (object) contains the configuration of the current application
2. `artifactsFolder` (string) is the location of the folder that contains all the packaging artifacts to be bundled
