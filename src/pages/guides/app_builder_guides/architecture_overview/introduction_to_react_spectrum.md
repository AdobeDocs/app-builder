# Introduction to React Spectrum

The React Spectrum project implements Adobe's [Spectrum](https://spectrum.adobe.com/) design language into React UI components.

React Spectrum is composed of:  

- **react-spectrum**, a component library implementing the Adobe Spectrum design system
- **react-aria**, a library of React hooks implementing the patterns defined in the ARIA practices specification, including mouse, touch, and keyboard behaviors, accessibility, and internationalization support
- **react-stately**, a library of React hooks implementing cross platform (for example web/native) state management for components that require it

React Spectrum supports accessibility and common-behavior handling out of the box. Incorporating React Spectrum in App Builder applications saves front-end development time, and allows styling and other design-specific features to be built on top of the library.

Sample templates generated through the CLI use React Spectrum in the UI as an example.
