# Forwarding Logs to Splunk Enterprise

This guide covers configuration of App Builder applications to forward logs to your Splunk Enterprise deployment.

## Prerequisites

1. An index on your Splunk Enterprise instance. Create a new index following [Splunk's guide](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.2.4/Indexer/Setupmultipleindexes).
2. Local development setup for your App Builder application
3. The latest version of AIO CLI. Check by running `aio --version`; update by running `npm install -g @adobe/aio-cli`

## Steps to configure log forwarding

### 1. Set up Splunk HTTP event collector

1. Go to your Splunk home and select select `Settings` from the ribbon and `Data Inputs` on the *Settings* pane

2. Click the `+ Add New` button corresponding to the HTTP Event Collector input type

3. On the _Select Source_ screen:
   
   1. Type in an input name. For example: `My App Builder Application` 
   2. Ensure that the _Enable Indexer Acknowledgment_ checkbox is **not** ticked.
   3. Click the _Next_ button on top.

4. On the *Input Settings* screen:
   
   - Set the source type to `automatic`. Forwarded logs will be sent with the `sourcetype` field set to `_json`
   - From the list of indexes, select only the index on which you wish to receive logs from your App Builder application
   - Click the `Review` button on top.

5. On the *Done* screen:
   
   - Copy the token value for later use.

### 2. Get your Splunk host and port

1. To find your `hostname` and `port` number, follow the procedures in [Send data to HTTP Event Collector on Splunk Enterprise](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.2.4/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector#Send_data_to_HTTP_Event_Collector_on_Splunk_Enterprise) from Splunk documentation.

2. Confirm your `hostname` and `port` number by executing this cURL request, using the token saved when you set up the Splunk HTTP event collector:
   
   ```
     curl -X POST 'https://<hostname>:<port>/services/collector' \     
   -H "Authorization: Splunk <token>" \
   -d '{"event": "hello world"}'
   ```
   
   A `200 OK` response confirms your `hostname` and `port`. Note that I/O Runtime supports only ports `443` and `8088` for port forwarding.
   
   ### 3. Set up log forwarding in App Builder
   
   1. Open Terminal and navigate to the App Builder project directory on your local machine.
   
   2. Run this command, supplying the values from previous steps:
   
   ```
      aio app config set log-forwarding
   ? select log forwarding destination: Splunk HEC
   ? host: <hostname>
   ? port: <port_number>
   ? index: <index>
   ? hec_token: <token>
   ```
   
   Note:
   
   - Be sure not to prefix the protocol (`http://` or `https://`) before the hostname
   - Use the `hostname` and `port` as determined in "Get Splunk host and port" above
   - Use the `token` value token saved when you set up the Splunk HTTP event collector

3. Verify that the configuration change has taken place:
   
   ```
   aio app config get log-forwarding
   ```

4. Execute an action in your App Builder application workspace to generate logs.

5. Go to Splunk Home > Search and run the query 
   
   ```
   index=<index>
   ```

6. If you don't see any logs in Splunk, check for log forwarding errors:
   
   ```
   aio app config get log-forwarding errors
   ```
