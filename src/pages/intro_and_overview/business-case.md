# Business case for App Builder

Enterprise organizations that want to extend the capabilities of their Adobe solutions will find a clear path forward in App Builder.

## Why use App Builder?

The main reasons to choose the App Builder framework over third-party point solutions or do-it-yourself customizations are:

- **Time to value** – App Builder is the fastest way to extend Adobe solutions.
- **Consistent user experience** – users can move smoothly between Adobe solutions and custom apps that share the same look and feel - without authenticating under a different username and password, switching contexts, or learning a new UI. 
- **Security** – API authorization and user access control are included with App Builder, and user access control is managed the same way as for Adobe solutions.
- **No infrastructure to manage** – one app or hundreds, one user or thousands, Adobe scales up behind the scenes and routes traffic to the closest region for effortless high performance.
- **Adobe-native** – integrated with Adobe solutions and services, App Builder offers more functionality out of the box and less code to write, deploy, and test. It also future-proofs your code, so you can incorporate new Adobe capabilities with minimal friction.

## Example use cases

Here are some typical applications that can be built with the App Builder framework:

- **Custom dashboards** and decision-support tools that use data from Adobe solutions or other systems
- **Custom experiences** that let users interact with Adobe solutions the way they want
- **Custom integrations** among Adobe, third-party, and custom home-grown systems. These can include apps with a UI, or automated solutions with no UI
- **Extended functionality**, adding new capabilities and integrations to Adobe solutions like Experience Manager Assets

Execution of App Builder apps on Adobe's I/O Runtime serverless platform adds event-driven, on-demand use cases to the range App Builder can address:

* **Microservices** without the burdens of server configuration and maintenance, which are often outside the skill sets of development teams

* **Adobe cloud platform extensions** by deploying microservices on top of Adobe's infrastucture to modify, transform, or automate interactions with content and data

* **Internet of Things** applications that standardize data inputs from multiple sensors, and scale to match the highly variable volume of sensor-driven events

* **API backend** that exposes REST APIs to other applications in the cloud, eliminating the need for servers to run them

* **Mobile backend** with the server-side functionality and scalability mobile applications typically need, but without the need for server-side development work

* **Data processing** and transformation pipelines that respond to events and adapt quickly to changing requirements with no need for reprogramming

* **Adobe I/O Event processing** executing logic that responds to events originating from Creative Cloud, Analytics Triggers, and other Adobe services
